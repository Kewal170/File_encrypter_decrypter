# File_encrypter_decrypter
Using this you can Encrypt the file(not the folder) and get the key, which will be decrypted, or else your files will be encrypted forever
NOTE::This will encrypt only files, not the folder.

<----- Steps to encrypt ----->
Step 1:Run the python program 'kewalhack.py' in a particular directory in which you want to encrypt the file.
Step 2:After running the program all the files are encrypted, and you will get the 'thekey.key' which is automatically generated by our 'kewalhack.py'.
Step 3:'thekey.key' is the key used to decrypt the files.

<----- Steps to decrypt ----->
Step 1:Run the python program 'kewalrelease.py' in a particular directory in which you want to decrypt the file.
Step 2:After running the program you will be asked for a secret code for decrypting, which in our case the code is 'kewal1712'.
Step 3:'thekey.key' should be present in the same directory 
Step 4:All the encrypted files are now decrypted.
